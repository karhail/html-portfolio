<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Born and raised in India. Moved to France in 2016. I love to travel and explore new places.</p>

<p>I'm a big fan of Marvel movies. But I'm mostly interested in startups and product building.</p>

<p>Building products that help people and it's a great way to stay disconnected from the internet as well. Just be in your own world. And also it's my way to do something big when I'm not in the country where I speak the language. So my skills are relevant to the companies here unless I can write code and just build and sell products.</p>
